# BME595A - Deep Learning

# Final Project Proposal

### Title : Segmentation of Overlapping Chromosomes

### Team Members : Naman Nandan

### Goals :
1. To understand the architecture of Neural Networks that are capable of performing image segmentation.

2. To implement a Neural Network that is capable of segmenting the regions of an input image (chromosomal preparations fixed on glass slides) that correspond to the two Chromosomes, region of overlap between them and the background.

3. To arrive at a Neural Network architecture that is simple enough to train only using CPU in reasonable time and can also potentially give short inference time.

### Challenges :

1. The required pre-processing of data so that the network may learn the required features efficiently.

2. Choosing the appropriate Neural Network architecture that can perform the task of segmentation for the dataset being used (potentially SegNet or U-Net).

3. Determining the balance between accuracy of segmentation (by using a deeper / complex Neural Network architecture) versus reasonable training and inference time.

4. Debugging cause for low accuracy of Neural Network output.
